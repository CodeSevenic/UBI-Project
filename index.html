        <p>
          Dear Shareholders<br /><br />
          In this latest newsletter I would like to share with you some of the important activities
          that we are busy with to take our company forward. <br /><br />
          Last year we achieved significant progress with our strategic actions and successfully
          achieved some of our objectives, despite the challenges of Covid-19. We completed several
          strategic transactions in 2020, of which the key ones include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increasing our shareholding in Alexander Forbes to become a major shareholder</li>
          <li>Acquiring a 25% interest in Sanlam's third-party asset management and</li>
          <li>
            An acquisition by Sanlam of a 25% interest in a subsidiary of ARC Financial Services.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We can be proud that we ended 2020 on a positive note. I am confident that the success we
          achieved in 2020 will carry through to 2021 as we focus on implementing our strategy and
          creating value for our shareholders and all stakeholders.<br /><br />
          I would like to wish all our shareholders and their families a healthy, happy and
          prosperous 2021.
        </p>

        <h2>UBI partnership with Sanlam reaches significant new milestone</h2>
        <h4>Sanlam acquires a shareholding in UBI financial services subsidiary</h4>
        <p>
          The 18-year long relationship between Ubuntu-Botho Investments (UBI) and the diversified
          financial services company Sanlam has reached a new milestone, with Sanlam agreeing to
          acquire a minority shareholding in a subsidiary of ARC Financial Services.<br /><br />
          Once the transaction has been concluded, Sanlam will have a 25% shareholding in the
          subsidiary company while ARC Financial Services will retain a 75% majority
          shareholding.<br /><br />
          The deal follows Sanlam’s 2018 announcement of a package of broad-based black economic
          empowerment (B-BBEE) transactions, which are intended to realise the Group’s South African
          growth strategy through enhanced B-BBEE.<br /><br />
          Mr Paul Hanratty, Sanlam Group CEO, said that Sanlam is delighted to have concluded this
          transaction with Ubuntu-Botho Investments. “This transaction strengthens our long-term
          strategic partnership with Ubuntu-Botho and creates the opportunity for further growth.
          Sanlam is well positioned to serve a wide range of clients and through our partnership
          with Ubuntu-Botho we are continuing to create tremendous value for a very broad set of
          stakeholders across South African society.”

        <h2>New CEO for rain</h2>
        <h4>Telecommunications company, rain, is key investment for ARC</h4>
        <p>
          rain is currently one of the most important assets in the ARC investment portfolio, which
          means that UBI shareholders are indirect owners of the company and should have a keen
          interest in its leadership.<br /><br />
          The company recently announced the current Group CEO, Willem Roos, will become a
          non-executive director on 1 March 2021, after completing his three-year contract. He will
          be succeeded by Brandon Leigh, the current Head of Strategy, as incoming CEO. There will
          be a six-month handover period to ensure a smooth transition.<br /><br />Brandon, as an
          original founder, now assumes the CEO role. Brandon holds a degree in electrical
          engineering from the University of Cape Town. He previously founded Leaf Wireless and won
          the South African leg of EY’s Emerging Entrepreneur of the Year award.

        <h2>Banking on success</h2>
        <h4>TymeBank goes from strength to strength</h4>
        <p>
          South Africa’s leading digital bank, TymeBank, continues to grow as it consistently
          onboards new customers every day. <br /><br />The bank currently boasts around 2.7 million
          customers, after it achieved the milestone of 1 million customers in November 2019. Some
          banking experts are saying that this impressive growth rate makes TymeBank one of the
          fastest growing digital banks in the world right now.<br /><br />
          The bank is showing some remarkable recovery as it continues to roll out its services to
          many more customers and has bounced back to pre-Covid growth rates. The bank continues to
          onboard 100 000 customers per month or 25 000 customers each week on average.

        <h4>Marlene raises the bar</h4>
        <p>
          As the General Counsel for African Rainbow Capital, Marlene Jennings has been at the fore
          of some of the company’s most significant developments. <br /><br />It therefore came as
          no surprise to her colleagues and associates when Marlene was one of only 12 legal
          professionals who were on the inaugural General Counsel Influencer Africa list, announced
          at this year’s Chambers Africa Awards for Excellence.<br /><br /><b
            >WELL DONE MARLENE. WE ARE PROUD TO HAVE YOU ON OUR TEAM!</b

        <h4>Putting others first</h4>
        <p>
          African Rainbow Capital’s Chief Operations Officer,
          <b>Brenda Matyolo, is a remarkable woman with a heart for other people.</b> Giving of
          herself to others is part of her DNA. <br /><br />Brenda shares that, for her, the best
          thing about ARC is the people: “We have some of the best brains and smartest people I’ve
          ever worked with. I love the flat structure and the fact that the executives sit among us
          in the open-plan office and engage with everyone.”<br /><br />Her business philosophy is
          “take nothing for granted, put your head down and let your work speak for itself, and
          seize opportunities with both hands”. From what we know about Brenda, this is a philosophy
          she has certainly applied to her own life.<br /><br />Looking ahead, she says there’s a
          lot more that needs to be done in the transformation space: “People have to take
          accountability and ownership for meaningful transformation and just do it. No hand-outs ‒
          they are unsustainable.”
