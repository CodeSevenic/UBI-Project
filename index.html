        <p>
          Dear Shareholders<br /><br />
          In this latest newsletter I would like to share with you some of the important activities
          that we are busy with to take our company forward. <br /><br />
          Last year we achieved significant progress with our strategic actions and successfully
          achieved some of our objectives, despite the challenges of Covid-19. We completed several
          strategic transactions in 2020, of which the key ones include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increasing our shareholding in Alexander Forbes to become a major shareholder</li>
          <li>Acquiring a 25% interest in Sanlam's third-party asset management and</li>
          <li>
            An acquisition by Sanlam of a 25% interest in a subsidiary of ARC Financial Services.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We can be proud that we ended 2020 on a positive note. I am confident that the success we
          achieved in 2020 will carry through to 2021 as we focus on implementing our strategy and
          creating value for our shareholders and all stakeholders.<br /><br />
          I would like to wish all our shareholders and their families a healthy, happy and
          prosperous 2021.
        </p>

        <h2>UBI partnership with Sanlam reaches significant new milestone</h2>
        <h4>Sanlam acquires a shareholding in UBI financial services subsidiary</h4>
        <p>
          The 18-year long relationship between Ubuntu-Botho Investments (UBI) and the diversified
          financial services company Sanlam has reached a new milestone, with Sanlam agreeing to
          acquire a minority shareholding in a subsidiary of ARC Financial Services.<br /><br />
          Once the transaction has been concluded, Sanlam will have a 25% shareholding in the
          subsidiary company while ARC Financial Services will retain a 75% majority
          shareholding.<br /><br />
          The deal follows Sanlam’s 2018 announcement of a package of broad-based black economic
          empowerment (B-BBEE) transactions, which are intended to realise the Group’s South African
          growth strategy through enhanced B-BBEE.<br /><br />
          Mr Paul Hanratty, Sanlam Group CEO, said that Sanlam is delighted to have concluded this
          transaction with Ubuntu-Botho Investments. “This transaction strengthens our long-term
          strategic partnership with Ubuntu-Botho and creates the opportunity for further growth.
          Sanlam is well positioned to serve a wide range of clients and through our partnership
          with Ubuntu-Botho we are continuing to create tremendous value for a very broad set of
          stakeholders across South African society.”

        <h2>New CEO for rain</h2>
        <h4>Telecommunications company, rain, is key investment for ARC</h4>
        <p>
          rain is currently one of the most important assets in the ARC investment portfolio, which
          means that UBI shareholders are indirect owners of the company and should have a keen
          interest in its leadership.<br /><br />
          The company recently announced the current Group CEO, Willem Roos, will become a
          non-executive director on 1 March 2021, after completing his three-year contract. He will
          be succeeded by Brandon Leigh, the current Head of Strategy, as incoming CEO. There will
          be a six-month handover period to ensure a smooth transition.<br /><br />Brandon, as an
          original founder, now assumes the CEO role. Brandon holds a degree in electrical
          engineering from the University of Cape Town. He previously founded Leaf Wireless and won
          the South African leg of EY’s Emerging Entrepreneur of the Year award.
